## Test tutorial

This file is included in order to test the function open_tutorial().


## Test workflow

Load the dayoff packge into memory (this shouldn't be necessary actually, but just to be sure...)
```{r}
library(dayoff)
```

Load some data contained in the package
```{r}
data(aa_chars)
```


Make a histogram using a packge which dayoff depends on, ggpubr
```{r}
gghistogram(data = aa_chars, x = "MW.da")
```
