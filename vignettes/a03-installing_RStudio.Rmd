## Installing RStudio

R is a programming language, and when you download it there is also a basic GUI (graphical user interface) that you can access via the R icon.

A brief overview of installing RStudio can be found here ["Getting RStudio on to your computer"](https://brouwern.github.io/BOOK_R_Ecological_Data_Science/getting-rstudio-on-to-your-computer.html)
