## Bioconductor

R packages (aka "libraries") can live in many places.  Most are accessed via **CRAN**, the Comprehensive R Archieve Network.  The bioinformatics and computational biology community also has its own package hosting system called [Bioconductor](www.bioconductor.org).  

To interface with Bioconductor you need the [BiocManager](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BiocManager/vignettes/BiocManager.html) package.  The Bioconductor people have put BiocManager on CRAN to allow you to set up interactions with Bioconductor.

Note that if you have an old version of R you will need to upate it to interact with bioconductor.


## Installing BiocManager

BiocManager can be installed using the install.packages() packages command.

```{r}
install.packages("BiocManager")
```

Once downloaded, BioManager needs to be explicitly loaded into your active R session
```{r}
library(BiocManager)
```

Individual packages can then be downloaded using the install() command.
```{r}
BiocManager::install("Biostrings")
```

Bioconductor has many **dependencies** - other packages which is relies on.  When you install Bioconductor packages you may need to update these packages.  If something seems to not be working during this process, restart R and being the Bioconductor installation process until things seem to work.


Again, to actually load the Biostrings package into your active R sessions requires the libary() command:
```{r}
library(Biostrings)
```

For more information on BiocManager see the vignette: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BiocManager/vignettes/BiocManager.html
